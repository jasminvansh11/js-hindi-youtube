# JavaScript Mini Projects (DOM) 🚀

These projects are built while learning from the **JavaScript series** on the YouTube channel [Chai aur Code](https://www.youtube.com/@chaiaurcode), owned by Hitesh Choudhary.  
Each project helped me understand **DOM manipulation** and apply JavaScript concepts in real-world examples.
